# pyfiddler
Use Python to call FiddlerCore and capture Both HTTP and HTTPS.

Auto supply the certificate when capture HTTPS . Use Bouncy Castle certificate generator to generates a root certificate and asks to trust it, then generates end-entity certificates on-the-fly for each domain visited with the root certificate as the signer.

- UsesCase：</br>
Put FiddlerCore4 in any path and append it to Python sys.path </br>
Put CertMaker.dll and BCMakeCert.dll to Python bin path like C:\python27 </br>
